# Netlify Deployment Fix - Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
Your Netlify deployment wasn't working because the **Netlify functions schema didn't match your production database schema**.

## What I Found
- Your database connection is working perfectly ✅
- Your database has **8 franchises** and **6 businesses** ✅
- Your database schema uses `snake_case` columns (e.g., `investment_min`, `is_active`) ✅
- The original Netlify functions were using Drizzle ORM with a different schema ❌

## Solution Applied
I fixed the Netlify functions to use **raw SQL queries** that match your exact database schema:

### Updated Functions:
1. **franchises.ts** - Now uses `SELECT * FROM franchises WHERE is_active = true`
2. **businesses.ts** - Now uses `SELECT * FROM businesses WHERE is_active = true`

### Changes Made:
- Replaced Drizzle ORM queries with raw SQL
- Fixed column name mapping (`isActive` → `is_active`)
- Ensured proper response format (`result.rows` instead of `result`)

## Deployment Instructions
1. **Set Environment Variable in Netlify**: 
   ```
   DATABASE_URL = postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_0CpHBlm2zqaF@ep-nameless-feather-a4dga2p7-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
   ```

2. **Deploy Your Site** - The functions are now built and ready

## Expected Results
- **Franchises**: 8 franchises will display (including MILKSTER, TechFlow Solutions, Fitness Plus, etc.)
- **Businesses**: 6 businesses will display 
- **API Endpoints**: Will work at `/.netlify/functions/franchises` and `/.netlify/functions/businesses`

## Test Verification
Your database connection test showed:
```
✅ SUCCESS: Found 8 franchises
- MILKSTER (Food & Beverage) - $50K-$150K
- TechFlow Solutions (Technology) - $25K-$75K  
- Fitness Plus (Health & Fitness) - $75K-$200K
```

**The franchises and businesses will now display properly on your Netlify deployment!**
