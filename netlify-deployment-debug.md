# Netlify Deployment Debug Analysis

## Issue: Franchises and Businesses Not Showing on Netlify

Based on your deployment issue, here are the most likely causes:

### 1. **Environment Variables Missing**
**Most Common Issue**: Your Netlify site doesn't have the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set.

**How to Fix**:
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add: `DATABASE_URL` = `your-neon-database-connection-string`
4. Redeploy your site

### 2. **Database is Empty on Production**
Your production database might not have the sample data.

**How to Fix**:
1. Connect to your production database
2. Run the INSERT statements I provided earlier
3. Or use a database migration tool

### 3. **Build Process Issues**
Functions might not be building correctly on Netlify.

**How to Check**:
1. Check your Netlify build logs
2. Look for errors in the "Functions" section
3. Verify all functions are deployed

### 4. **CORS Issues**
The frontend might not be able to connect to the functions.

**How to Fix**:
- Functions already have CORS headers configured
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### 5. **Database Connection String Format**
Netlify functions might need a specific format for the DATABASE_URL.

**Current Format**: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`
**Required Format**: Same (should work)

## Testing Steps

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # In Netlify functions, add this debug log:
   console.log('DATABASE_URL exists:', !!process.env.DATABASE_URL);
   ```

2. **Test Function Directly**:
   Visit: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/franchises`
   Should return JSON data or error message

3. **Check Database Connection**:
   Add debug logging to see if database queries are working

## Most Likely Solution

The issue is almost certainly that your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not set in your Netlify deployment. Your code is working perfectly here on Replit with the database connection, but Netlify needs the same environment variable configured.

Set the `DATABASE_URL` in Netlify's environment variables and redeploy - this should fix the issue immediately.
